adding code to repository
Create two ec2 in AWS   
create java application on one server 
Deploy the java application on other application --  do not copy the source code on another ec2 Application 


Details steps for dev server  




Command to copy java file from local machine to ec2 dev machine   
scp -i test_key.pem "/c/HarishKemkar/local_repo/JAVA project/MyApp.java" ec2-user@15.206.68.112:~/java_application/


how to ins

INStall maven on ec2 (Build server)
sudo dnf install maven -y

Create maven project structure  

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.myapp \
    -DartifactId=myapp \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
    -DinteractiveMode=false

place your code  for maven  

 mv /home/ec2-user/java_application/MyApp.java /home/ec2-user/java_application/myapp/src/main/java/com/myapp/





mvn clean package

transfer binary 
scp -i target_key.pem target/myapp.jar ec2-user@<target-ec2-ip>:~/java_application/


install jre on ec2 server 

run the aplication 
java -jar ~/java_application/myapp.jar



*** Steps from co pilot --    

. Build the JAR
From inside the myapp directory:
cd ~/myapp
mvn clean package


Output will be in:
target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar



5. Run the Application
java -cp target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.myapp.MyApp
java -cp target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.myapp.MyApp

- java
- This invokes the Java runtime (JVM).
- It’s the program that executes compiled .class files.
- -cp target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
- -cp means classpath.
- The classpath tells Java where to look for compiled classes and resources.
- Here, you’re saying: “Look inside the JAR file target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar for my classes.”
- 👉 Without this, Java wouldn’t know where to find com.myapp.MyApp.
- com.myapp.MyApp
- This is the fully qualified class name (FQCN).
- It means: run the class MyApp inside the package com.myapp.
- Java looks inside the JAR, finds com/myapp/MyApp.class, and executes its main() method.



6. Deploy to Another EC2
Copy only the JAR (not source code):
scp -i target_key.pem target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ec2-user@<target-ec2-ip>:~/java_application/


On the target EC2:
java -cp ~/java_application/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.myapp.MyApp



👉 This way, you build once on EC2 #1, and deploy only the artifact to EC2 #2.
Would you like me to also show you how to make the JAR executable with java -jar (instead of specifying the class name), so it runs more cleanly like a standalone app
